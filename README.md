# Garrett's Funfolio [![BADGE](https://img.shields.io/badge/License%3A-MIT-blue)](https://img.shields.io/badge/License%3A-MIT-blue)
## Description
Hello! This is my React Portfolio. I plan on adding many fun features and functionality to showcase my knowledge about web development. I'm stuck between adding things randomly as I see fit, or systematically to create a "library" of sorts. In any case, W3Schools seems to have already achieved that pretty well.
